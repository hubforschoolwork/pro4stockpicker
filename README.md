Stock Picker

•	This basic app offers users a straightforward approach to gain familiarity with navigating a stock trading platform.
•	Through current and historical stock data, users can assess a stock’s performance.
•	Stock data, stock tickers and charts are in real time.  Historical data is presented in a 5-year chart.
•	Buy and sell features allow users to pick stocks from among the following list which includes pre-populated sample data for price/quantity amounts via a dropdown selection menu:

  o	Google
  o	General Electric
  o	Microsoft
  o	Amazon

•	A preset limit of $5,000 has been included to purchase stocks. 
•	A preset limit of $5,000 has been included to sell stocks.
•	A reset button has been placed on the buy and sell pages so a user can reset their transaction page to $0.00.
•	As each transaction is submitted (buy/sell), the transaction page will be updated.
•	Once the transactions (buy/sell) reach the $5,000 limit, all further transactions will not be processed.  An alert will appear on the screen and the transactions above the allowable limit will appear in “red” as a signal to show these transactions will not be processed.

•	Technologies used are:
  o	Django/Python
  o	.CSS
  o	HTML
  o	JavaScript
  o	Bootstrap
  o	TradingView – For stock prices/graphs and stock ticker widgets


Suggested Future Enhancements:
  o	Expanded access to all securities on all stock exchanges rather than limited to four stocks.
  o	Buy and sell pages could be expanded to allow for access to all securities on all stock exchanges.
  o	Expanded securities would require views of all stock data/charts/historical data.
  o	Stock price alerts allowing users to purchase or sell a stock at a particular price.
  o	Portfolio stock positions/balances on homepage.
  o	Search box to get instant quotes on all stock on exchanges.
  o	Add a login feature so users can save their portfolios.
  o	Allow a single user to add more than one portfolio to their account.

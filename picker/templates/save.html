    Sure, let's break down the regular expression pattern `r'(\w+) - (\d+) = \$(\d+\.\d{2})'` step by step:

    ### Regular Expression Breakdown
    1. **`r'...'`**: The `r` before the string indicates a raw string, which means backslashes are treated literally and not as escape characters. This is useful for regular expressions to avoid having to double escape characters.
    
    2. **`(\w+)`**:
       - **`(` and `)`**: Parentheses are used to capture the matched content as a group.
       - **`\w`**: Matches any word character (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`).
       - **`+`**: Matches one or more of the preceding element. So, `\w+` matches one or more word characters.
       - **`(\w+)`**: This captures a sequence of one or more word characters as a group.
    
    3. **` - `**: Matches the literal string " - " (space, hyphen, space).
    
    4. **`(\d+)`**:
       - **`\d`**: Matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).
       - **`+`**: Matches one or more of the preceding element. So, `\d+` matches one or more digits.
       - **`(\d+)`**: This captures a sequence of one or more digits as a group.
    
    5. **` = \$`**:
       - **` = `**: Matches the literal string " = " (space, equals sign, space).
       - **`\$`**: Matches the literal dollar sign `$`. The backslash is used to escape the dollar sign, which is a special character in regular expressions.
    
    6. **`(\d+\.\d{2})`**:
       - **`\d+`**: Matches one or more digits.
       - **`\.`**: Matches the literal dot `.`. The backslash is used to escape the dot, which is a special character in regular expressions.
       - **`\d{2}`**: Matches exactly two digits.
       - **`(\d+\.\d{2})`**: This captures a sequence of one or more digits followed by a dot and exactly two digits as a group.
    
    ### Putting It All Together
    The pattern `r'(\w+) - (\d+) = \$(\d+\.\d{2})'` matches strings that follow the format "word - number = $number.number", and captures three groups:
    1. A sequence of word characters (e.g., "MSFT").
    2. A sequence of digits (e.g., "6").
    3. A dollar amount with two decimal places (e.g., "2712.96").
    
    ### Example
    For the string `"MSFT - 6 = $2712.96"`, the pattern will match and capture:
    - Group 1: `"MSFT"`
    - Group 2: `"6"`
    - Group 3: `"2712.96"`
    
    This allows you to extract these specific parts of the string easily.
